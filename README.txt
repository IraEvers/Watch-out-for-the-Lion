First of all thank your for reading this README, I appraciate that.

OPEN THE PROJECT
There are three possibilities:
1. View my project on GitHub and browse through it's contents.
2. Open the project in Unity.
  2.1 Download the project from GitHub.
  2.2 Open the project with the UnityHub.
  2.3 Make sure to use Unity Editor 2020.3.18f1 (windows 64 bit).
  2.4 When the project has been opened (and no further erros occur caused by missing files) open the "Menu" scene if it has not already been activated. The "Menu" scene can be found in the folder "Scenes" under "Assets".
  2.5 If the "Menu" scene has been opened, press the play button (above the scene/game view window) and enjoy.
3. If you have the build of the game dubble-press the execution(exe.) file.


CHOICES ON DESIGN
I wanted to make a game for children. It needed to be simple and straightforward.

The overal estethic of these assets are unrealistic and cute. 
The used art assets both 3D and 2D have many different colours which appeals to children.

The game background is overal green-blue. 
Blue being associated with cold and chillyness creates a calming effect on children. 
Green being associated with nature making children feel more comfortable and also relaxes the children. Imagery of plants has been put into the backrgound to empathize the feeling of nature even more.
The buttons that are used are fairly big to lower the chance of misspressing them.
The buttons are made orange because this is an energetic colour that calls for action yet not as aggresive like red. It also stands out from the background as it is a complimentary colour from green.

The cuteness for 2D is conveyed throught the glimmers in the eyes, the friendly faces of animals who blush and their slightly bigger heads makes them look more cute. 
Bigger faces are associated by our brain with babies both animal and human.
The 3D asset animals contain somewhat of a bigger head as well. In addtion, their unrealistic design (block-ish) makes their look more simple and cute. Making it fit for children.
The 3D asset food or collectables are more realistic in terms of shape yet are highly stylized and have a smoothend edges. This will fit for children as a lot of childrens' toys are stylized as well.

The music and sounds are chosen to be fairly bright. When the player collects food it creates an eating sound suggesting the player eats the food. 
Together with the dissapearance of the item it will look real and/or magical to the children which results in them being curious or laughing.
A slightly up-tempo music has been chosen for the menu(s) to create a fun and vibrant enviroment.
The up-tempo swinging music used within the game is used to not only make the game sound vibrant and fun, it also fits with the speed with which the game is played.
The more down-tempo music that is being played when losing should create a certain amount of rest for the children after playing such a high paced game. 
Even though the sound is more down-tempo it stays consistend because of it's changing musical pattern.
The growling lion should not be to scary, therfore I used the sound of a yawning lion rather than a roaring lion. This makes the sound rather sad in stead of an aggresive sound which might scare the children.
The quick pace of the game will allow children to be distracted in diffcult situations. 
The children can pick the animal (or Cube!) they like to play with. 
This creates a certain amount of attachement to their charachter. Because of this identification they will try harder to sruvive within the game and surpase their own highscore.
Using highscores will stimulate the children to stay engaged as they will try to continualy break their own highscore. 

The simplicity of design can also been seen in it is game mechanices.
Children that have played online games before will more often use AWSD (and Space Bar) as controls and children with no experience will often rather use the arrow keys.
The game has been set-up as such that both is possible. To not overload the brain of a kid the game will only focus on moving left or right (but you can jump if you want).
Meaning that the children playing the game will only need to focus on two buttons, the player postion and objects on their way. 
I have chosen to only use a score and no other combinations like health, power-ups and timers because this might put to much stress on children playing the game.

Kindest Regards,
Ira Evers
